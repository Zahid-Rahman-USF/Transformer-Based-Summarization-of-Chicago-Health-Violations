Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
bashCopyEditpython -m venv env source env/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux env\\Scripts\\activate      # Windows 
Install required packages
Run this from the project folder where requirements.txt is:
bashCopyEditpip install -r requirements.txt
Check the model folder is present
Make sure the flan_t5_small_plain_lora folder is in the project root
(It should contain adapter_model.safetensors, tokenizer.json, etc.)
Start the Flask server
bashCopyEditpython app.py
If all goes well, you’ll see:
csharpCopyEdit* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ 
Open Postman and import your collection
Open Postman
Click Import > File > Choose your .json file
Three requests should show up:
Summarize Custom Violation
Fetch and Summarize Violations
Search and Summarize Violations
Use Search and Summarize
That’s the main one for the project.
Choose POST
Set body to:
jsonCopyEdit{"query": "Tijuana Flats 4050 East Fowler" } 
or something like:
jsonCopyEdit{"query": "The Dearborn" } 
Click Send
You’ll see structured JSON output with summaries (if model works).
